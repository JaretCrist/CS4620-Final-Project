2,Dragonborn,,3,"Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.||||||Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.|||||||||Age. Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.|||||||||Alignment. Dragonborn tend towards extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other between Good and Evil (represented by Bahamut and Tiamat, respectively). More side with Bahamut than Tiamat (whose non-dragon followers are mostly kobolds), but villainous dragonborn can be quite terrible indeed. Some rare few choose to devote themselves to lesser dragon deities, such as Chronepsis (Neutral), and fewer still choose to worship Io, the Ninefold Dragon, who is all alignments at once.|||||||||Size. Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.|||||||||Speed.

21,Bishtahar/Tirahar Elves,Elf,2,"Elves who dwell in the forest and countryside are known as the Bishtahar. Most live in isolated communities away from other races, though they still trade with them. In fact, much of Kaladesh’s food supply is grown by elves. Bishtahar cultivators grow food, decorative flowers, wood for building, and elaborate living sculptures in their meandering gardens and fields. They use the plane’s ubiquitous technology to foster the growth of plants and animals, utilizing automatons as gardeners and herders, and employing elaborate, nearly invisible systems controlling heat, water, and nutrients.|||Elves who forsake technology entirely are called the Tirahar. Some elves with Tirahar sympathies live within cities or farms, but most simply withdraw to the wilder areas of Kaladesh. No more than one in a hundred elves is counted among the Tirahar, and many members of other races are unaware that these reclusive elves even exist.||||||Ability Score Increase.

22,Vahadar Elf,Elf,2,"The Vahadar are elves who dwell in the cities of Kaladesh. They are comfortable with technology, and work as planners, architects, aether-seers, or inventors. Some of them use the techniques of Bishtahar cultivators to grow food on rooftops, towers, and greenways. The Vahadar are generally integrated into the rest of society on Kaladesh, living in cities dominated by the other races (though, as in Ghirapur, many of them live in specific garden-like neighborhoods) and engaging in trade.||||||Ability Score Increase.

23,Zendikar Features,Elf,2,"Elves are strongly associated with nature, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.|||The elves of Zendikar have much in common with the elves of other worlds. Your elf character has the following traits.||||||Ability Score Increase. Your Wisdom score increases by 2.|||||||||Age. Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.|||||||||Alignment. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not. Drow are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.|||||||||Size. Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.|||||||||Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.|||||||||Darkvision. Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.|||||||||Fey Ancestry. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.|||||||||Trance. Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is ""trance."" While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.|||||||||Keen Senses. You have proficiency in the Perception skill.|||||||||Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Elven.||||||"
24,Tajuru,Elf,2,"The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans.

The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.||||||Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.|||||||||Skill Versatility. You gain proficiency in any combination of two skills or tools of your choice.||||||"
25,Juraga,Elf,2,"The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar — or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves’ only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans’ aggressive exterior.||||||Ability Score Increase.

26,Mul Daya,Elf,2,"Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.|||Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.||||||Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 1.|||||||||Superior Darkvision. Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet.|||||||||Sunlight Sensitivity.

28,Gurgach Elf,Elf,53,"Source: Unearthed Arcana 46 - Elf Subraces|||The grugach of the world of Greyhawk shun contact with other folk, preferring the solace of the deepest forests and the companionship of wild animals. Even other elves draw their suspicion.|||The grugach tend toward chaos and neutrality. They feel no special duty to anyone beyond their own folk and the forest that is their home. Troubles beyond their borders are best kept there. At the same time, they harbor little ambition beyond a peaceful coexistence with nature.|||If anyone is fool enough to disturb a grugach realm, these elves take to arms and fight in earnest. Grugach master the basic weapons needed to hunt and forage in the wood. Every copse of trees becomes a sniper's nest, and each forest meadow is an ambush point. The grugach set pits filled with stakes, snares that leave an intruder helpless to grugach arrows, and other snares designed to kill rather than capture.

79,Eladrin,,8,"Eladrin are elves native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. An eladrin is associated with one of the four seasons and has coloration reminiscent of that season, which can also affect the eladrin's mood:||||||Autumn is the season of peace and goodwill, when summer's harvest is shared with all.|||Winter is the season of contemplation and dolor, when the vibrant energy of the world slumbers.|||Spring is the season of cheerfulness and celebration, marked by merriment as winter's sorrow passes.|||Summer is the season of boldness and aggression, a time of unfettered energy.||||||Some eladrin remain associated with a particular season for their entire lives, whereas other eladrin transform, adopting characteristics of a new season.|||When finishing a long rest, any eladrin can change their season. An eladrin might choose the season that is present in the world or perhaps the season that most closely matches the eladrin's current emotional state. For example, an eladrin might shift to autumn if filled with contentment, another eladrin could change to winter if plunged into sorrow, still another might be bursting with joy and become an eladrin of spring, and fury might cause an eladrin to change to summer.|||The following tables offer personality suggestions for eladrin of each season.

Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is ""trance.""

165,Merfolk,,2,"Curious, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.|||Merfolk are associated with knowledge, logic, and strategy, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.||||||Ability Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1.|||||||||Age. Merfolk mature at the same rate humans do and reach adulthood around the age of 20.

You can speak, read, and write Common, Merfolk and one additional language of your choice.|||||||||Creeds. The merfolk race is divided into three creeds, founded on the principles of Emeria (wind), Ula (water), and Cosi (the trickster). A merfolk isn’t born into a creed but chooses it upon reaching adulthood, and it is rare for a merfolk not to choose a creed. Merfolk of the wind and water creeds aren’t hostile to each other, but members of each creed regard the other creed with a vague disdain. Members of both those creeds regard the Cosi creed with suspicion and some degree of fear, and Cosi-creed adherents tend to keep their affiliation secret. Choose one of these creeds for your character.||||||Emeria (Wind) Creed||||||Merfolk who followed Emeria’s creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces—rather than natural causes—behind historical events.
